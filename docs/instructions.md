## Top 10 Proactive Controls
### About This Project

Insecure software is a growing threat to critical sectors such as finance, healthcare, defense, and energy.  
As our global digital infrastructure becomes more complex and interconnected, ensuring application security grows exponentially more difficult.  
We can no longer afford to overlook even the most basic security vulnerabilities.

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Objectives
The **OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls** is created to raise awareness of essential application security practices.  
It outlines the most important areas that developers need to understand to create secure software.

By learning from the mistakes of others, developers can proactively protect their applications from common threats.  
Use this guide as a starting point to integrate security into your development process from the ground up.

### ðŸ‘¥ Audience

While this guide is particularly valuable for **developers**, itâ€™s not limited to them.  
**Project managers**, **quality assurance (Q/A) specialists**, and **anyone involved in software development** can benefit from understanding and applying these proactive controls.  
Security is a shared responsibility across the entire development lifecycle.
